# RESPONSIVE PANELS

Responsive web design is an approach to building websites that ensures optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes. By employing flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries, responsive design allows web pages to adapt dynamically to various viewport sizes, enabling seamless browsing on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This enhances user experience and accessibility, as content adjusts fluidly to fit the device, eliminating the need for separate mobile versions of websites.
